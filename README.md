# TerraPeep721

NFT contract for the TerraPeep project
## TODO
- [x] Add a `set_sign` function to allow the owner to set the public verification key
- [x] Add a `set_price` function to allow the owner to set auction price


## Creating a new repo from template

Assuming you have a recent version of rust and cargo (v1.51.0+) installed
(via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)),
then the following should get you a new repo to start a contract:


## CI Support

We have template configurations for both [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/Basic.yml)
and [Circle CI](.circleci/config.yml) in the generated project, so you can
get up and running with CI right away.

One note is that the CI runs all `cargo` commands
with `--locked` to ensure it uses the exact same versions as you have locally. This also means
you must have an up-to-date `Cargo.lock` file, which is not auto-generated.
The first time you set up the project (or after adding any dep), you should ensure the
`Cargo.lock` file is updated, so the CI will test properly. This can be done simply by
running `cargo check` or `cargo unit-test`.

## Using your project

Once you have your custom repo, you should check out [Developing](./Developing.md) to explain
more on how to run tests and develop code. Or go through the
[online tutorial](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/) to get a better feel
of how to develop.

[Publishing](./Publishing.md) contains useful information on how to publish your contract
to the world, once you are ready to deploy it on a running blockchain. And
[Importing](./Importing.md) contains information about pulling in other contracts or crates
that have been published.

Please replace this README file with information about your specific project. You can keep
the `Developing.md` and `Publishing.md` files as useful referenced, but please set some
proper description in the README.

## Gitpod integration

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) container-based development platform will be enabled on your project by default.

Workspace contains:
 - **rust**: for builds
 - [wasmd](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd): for local node setup and client
 - **jq**: shell JSON manipulation tool

Follow [Gitpod Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) and launch your workspace.
